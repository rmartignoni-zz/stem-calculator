# stem-calculator

This tool was created to help cyclists to visualize and calculate exactly the difference between two stems (length and height).

You can integrate this library with your project to draw charts or just get the approximate comparison between stems.

## TODO

* Fix the calculations when spacers are added (drawing is OK)
